We would like you to do a coding challenge which I send you below:

Please implement a small service using DocuSign SDK: https://github.com/docusign/docusign-php-client

Step 1: Create Envelope from template. 
Step 2: Send Envelope with Embedded Recipient
Step 3: Generate the Recipient Signing URL

Requirements:
Use https://github.com/docusign/docusign-php-client SDK for implementation
The service should create the envelope from template.
Template must have some tabs which would be injected dynamically.
End result would be like: https://loancosample.docusign.com/loan/personal 
If you like to implement without UI and handle that in one file/class that is fine for us, but the end result should be the same as application. 
If you are missing any requirements or further information, please just make assumptions and document them for us.

We are looking forward to receiving your solution within the next 7 days!
